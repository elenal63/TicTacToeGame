# Overview

This is a Tic Tac Toe game I created using Swift and Xcode. I wanted to learn more about creating a mobile app and become more familiar with SwiftUI.

In this game, there is an opening page that will direct to the game page once the user selects start game. The game is for two players and will display the score after each round as well as who's turn it is. Once a round is over a message will display who won or if the game is a draw. Then the user can restart the game. 

I have never used Xcode before, so I wanted to learn more about it. I also find mobile app development fascinating, so it was a good experience taking the time to learn more about it.
